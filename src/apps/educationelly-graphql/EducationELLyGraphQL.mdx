# educationELLy-GraphQL

GraphQL-powered education platform — Apollo Client with real-time queries, mutations, and student management.

## Stack

- **React 18** with styled-components + Semantic UI CSS
- **Apollo Client 4** with GraphQL queries and mutations
- **Express + GraphQL** backend

## Components

| Component | Stories | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Header** | Authenticated, Unauthenticated | Auth-aware navigation header |
| **Students** | WithStudents, SearchFiltering, Empty | Student list with real-time search filtering |
| **CreateStudent** | NewStudent, EditExisting, FillForm | Student creation/edit form with GraphQL-formatted fields |
| **ChatBubble** | Closed, OpenEmpty, WithConversation | AI assistant focused on reclassification guidance |

## How It Differs from educationELLy

This is a **GraphQL rewrite** of the educationELLy app. Key differences:

- Data uses `_id` (MongoDB) instead of numeric `id`
- Students include `nativeLanguage` and `countryOfBirth` fields
- Chat assistant focuses on reclassification criteria
- No pagination component — replaced by client-side search filtering

## Interaction Tests

- **CreateStudent/FillForm** — Fills all student fields and submits
- **Students/SearchFiltering** — Types a search query and verifies filtered results
